# Contributing Guidelines

Some basic conventions for contributing to this project.

### General

* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* Develop in a topic branch, not master
* Squash your commits


### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should include a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
 <type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Lines should not exceed 100 characters:

```
 #270 fix(config): only override publicPath when served by webpack
 #269 feat(ChangeDetection): add change detection module
```

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

#### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.

#### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
