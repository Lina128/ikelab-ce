## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0`
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Installation
After confirming that your environment meets the above [requirements](#requirements), checkout this project and give it a new name:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lina128/cubius.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

When that's done, install the project dependencies. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

## Running the Project
After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:1300`|
|`deploy`           |Builds the application to ./dist|

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the **fractal** pattern demonstrated in this project (https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) by Davezuko.

## Live Development

### Hot Reloading

Hot reloading is enabled by default when the application is running in development mode (`yarn start`). With hot reloading, your code updates can be reflected in the app while it's running without restart the server. This is very useful for development. Read more about [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html).


## Deployment

Out of the box, this project is deployable by serving the `./dist` folder generated by `yarn deploy`. The simplest deployment strategy is a [static deployment](#static-deployments).

### Static Deployments

Serve the application with a web server such as nginx by pointing it at your `./dist` folder. Make sure to direct incoming route requests to the root `./dist/index.html` file.
